1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,790
And as you walk through, you could

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,990
see that there was a big shipping

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,830
container at the back within the workshop.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,950
You always look at every aspect of

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,269
their life.

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,099
So you look at where they live,

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,980
where they frequent, where they work.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,759
So his workplace came to light as

9
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:17,579
a potential area for investigation.

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,460
It just destroys DNA.

11
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,480
You've got to have a significant amount

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,000
of bone to be able to preserve

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,100
the DNA within it, to be able

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,820
to get DNA.

15
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,260
I need to try it.

16
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
So we picked the biggest seven pieces

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,780
of bone to see whether we could

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,560
obtain DNA.

19
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,600
They tried.

20
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,579
They couldn't get anything.

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,340
We were never going to be able

22
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,200
to prove that bone was definitively Alex's

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,700
by DNA.

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,659
It's frustrating.
