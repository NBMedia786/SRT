00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,560

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,339

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,160

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,359
to be 5 '6".

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,190

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,510

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:27,960

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,600

00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,840

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,020

31
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,840
Yo, we're not scared of you.

32
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,760
That's a fact.

33
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,840
But you guys are being fucking actually

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,299
aggressive and it's annoying.

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Don't be aggressive to me.

36
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,159

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,500

38
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,939
That little, that little, that little push.

39
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,019
Oh my god, I'm so tough.

40
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,379

44
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,959
How about you guys be cool cops?

45
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,319

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,939
Oh my god.

51
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,739

00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,719
See, he thinks I...

53
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,519
I didn't drive.

54
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:34,760
I didn't drive.

55
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm in no trouble.

56
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,340
I'm fine.

57
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,500
I'm in no trouble.

58
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,359
Everybody, every single one of these cocksuckers

59
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,540
can get on their knees and suck

60
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,400

61
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,599
They're sitting here like they're important, but

62
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,200
they need to go.

63
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,540
Nah, he's not important.

64
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:50,739
He's like fucking...

65
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,379
He might be.

66
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,500
You guys should have walked away.

67
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,159
He's 22 years old.

68
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,159
He's 22 years old.

69
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,299
Are we home?

70
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,959

71
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,280
